				<p>I am team player and hard worker looking for a job that requires an individual with a little bit of everything.  From my educational background as a physics major at James Madison University I gained skills in logical thinking and problem solving.  My work since graduating has given me experiance in customer service, team work, and operating in an intense fast paced enviorment.  
				</p>
				<p>
				During my time conducting research for JMU I developed a skill for writing code and seeing a project through.  Although the bulk of my research was done alone, I was guided by my research professor, and was part of a team of individuals who worked on different projects but had the same goal of improving our knowledge of soft condensed materials. 
				</p>
				<p> 
				This experience demonstrates that I am self-motivated yet exhibits an ability to take orders, be mentored, and operate as part of a team.  My research required that I be driven, think both critically and creatively, and be passionate about what I do.  I am confident that I will bring the same qualities to this position.  I wish to be in an environment that breeds intellectual growth and provides unique challenges.
				</p>
				<p>This site was created, from scratch, by me and hosted by Github pages.  This site is meant to show my abilities and give you an insight into my personal style and who I am as a worker and a person.  The introductory animation that welcomed you into the site was created in Blender, everything else on the site is made of HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and Ajax.  Thank you for your time!
